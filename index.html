            <p>
                My name is Claire Ferris. I am a parcticing registered midwife in the South-East of Ireland. 
                I qualified as a Nurse in 2006 and went on to qualify as a midwife in 2012.
                I am so passionate about my work and love providing newborns and thier families the best start in life.
                In 2020, I was lucky enough to undertake a course in Lactation Consultancy and I am now registered with 
                the International Board of Certified Lactation Consultants. 
                I can provide you with the best up to date, evidence based care, to help you get you feel confident and 
                support you throughout this challenging time!
                As a mother myself I understand the struggles we face as new parents and the difficulties that 
                newborn feeding can throw at us. With the right support, direction and knowledge, together we can 
                kickstart your breastfeeding journey and give you and your newborn the best possible start in life!
